**📌What is the Compressive Strength of Concrete?**

Concrete compressive strength is a critical parameter in the construction industry as it determines the ability of concrete to withstand loads and pressures. ML models can be used to predict this strength based on various input variables, which can include the composition of the concrete mix, curing conditions, and other factors.

✔️In this project, we aim to create optimum ML models to forecast the compressive strength of concrete using its features (compositions of the mixture).
